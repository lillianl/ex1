        <h2 id="work"> the UX Book: Introduction</h2>
            <p> 
                <br> 
                The definition of computing is changing everyday. Computer systems have become more ubiquitous, meaning that their uses are expanding and no longer solely require traditional screens to operate. They are being worn by people in wearable technology ventures, are embedded within appliances, and are generally unnoticeable because they are so blended into the environment. Weiser says in 1991 that “the most profound technologies are the ones that disappear. Most user-computer interaction attendants (think Jarvis from Ironman) exist now without keyboards, mice, or even monitors. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Thus, the concept and definition of interaction is also changing. We do not need to require traditional user interface to have interaction. There is purposeful interaction with computers, but there is also interaction that do not require screens such as using a car’s computer, and maybe even a GPS though we generally do not associate these tasks as “doing computing”. We can now say that interaction can involve anything that requires an exchange between a system and a user. While both components can influence the external world, their interaction with each other is different. User related input can change the internal system state while the system can either take input from the user or even extract inputs from users on its own by sensing them in its environment.  Another example is the standard highway sign. A road sign is like a computer message in which it tells drivers what to do while drivers takes actions within the overarching highway system. Basically, interaction is more than just about traditional human-computer interaction. It should more so be described as human-world interaction.    
            </p>
            <p>
            Usability is an emerging necessity. A metaphor for this need is the dancing bear concept. Sometimes a feature may seem so good, either because of its rarity or its novelty, that people overlook bad design,  just as if a dancing bear would awe people so much that they would overlook the fact that the bear might not be dancing well. Good interaction design will always make a product or feature better. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Beyond objective user performance (e.g. efficiency and user count) there is also a subjective measure called user satisfaction. User satisfaction may be the emotional impact in a user since technology and design now have reached more personal and intimate levels beyond it just being a measure of productivity. Functionality is important, but features that aren’t accessible by a user effectively do not exist (Larry Marine). Good user experience will keep users coming back for more. User experience as it is defined in the field is usually seen as the “totality of the effect or effects felt (experienced) internally by a user as a result of interaction with, and the usage context of, a system, device, or product”. The main thing to note is that users mostly feel user experience internally, though there are some external measurements possible (e.g. time spent on a task). The general rule is that usability by itself refers to the pragmatic aspect of the experience while user experience refers to what the user feels in effect to that. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Emotional impact includes pleasant feelings but may also refer to feelings like love, hate, and fear. These can cause behavioral change. An example is the iPad, which sold not because of inherent functional need, but because of emotional allure. Taking context into account, there is no such thing as design that can be expected to lead to a concrete specified user experience, however it is beneficial for designers to know more about context so that they will be better equipped to design for the best experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
            So, why is user experience important in the business setting? Badly designed software costs millions annually and requires training and support, which sucks more resources. Even if it’s selling well, it might be because of other reasons like rarity, or a strong marketing platform. These do not take care of user problems and training attempts such as instructional bulletins do not work and will also cost. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, user experience has its roots in a number of fields, namely Psychology, Cognitive Science, Human Factors Engineering, and Computer Science. Psychology and cognitive science play a large part in user experience through observation of human behavior and information on how humans process information. Psychology and cognitive science are both more concerned with the human but human factors engineering looks at the human in conjunction of a larger system. Computer science plays a part through interactive graphics, devices, and interaction techniques.

        <h2 id="work"> Foundation </h2>
        <p> I used Zurb's foundation to test out their flexbible grid system. I went with a portfolio site as a simple exercise. Here are some useful links:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li> <a href="//foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb's Website</a></li>
                <li> <a href="//foundation.zurb.com/sites/resources.html">Resources for Sites</a></li>
                <li> <a href="//foundation.zurb.com/grid.html">Instructions for the grid </a></li>
            </ul>
                 <p> Foundation is a reponsive CSS framework. It can be used to build sites, build apps, or build quick prototypes. You can download foundation as a whole, or use it's customize feature to download a personalized kit that has custom css already in your index.html. </p> 
                 <br>
                 <img src="images/customize.jpg"> 
                 <p> It downloads a few stylesheets, one that has default css that should not be touched in good practice because Zurb continuously keeps updates. This keeps your websites up to date. There's a blank css document included in the download called app.css, which is the stylesheet that we are allowed to customize, which will override the default styling.</p>
                 <br> 
                 <img src="images/sample.jpg">
                 <p> The greatest feature of Foundation imo, is its responsive grid which is adjusted via code such as this or the block grid: </p>

        <h2 id="work"> Pocket Full of Interface</h2>
        <img src="images/ex4.png"/> 
        <p> In the exercise, 'Pocket Full of Interface', I went with a very simple design that is largely focused on the animation and the illustration in the five main boxes. The interface is largely focused on a few things: 
            <ul> 
                <li> The interactivity of the hovers in each box invites the user to interact with the interface and indicates that the area within the hover may be important. The animation transistion itself is aesthetically appealing and adds to the 'fun of the entire page. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                When clicked, the toggle option allows the user to interact with short drop down descriptions that are clean. This allows the description to be read quickly (is skimmable). The slideToggle option is also appealing becasue of the smooth transistion.          
                </li>
                <li> 
                Finally, the title of the slide is bold and introduces the project in a straight forward way. I've added 'Lillian's Essentials' as a sub title for a more specific way to introduce the items and their descriptions. I also do believe that the typeface chosen is a fun and quirkly complement to the playful illustrations below the heading. 
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="work"> Time is on My Side </h2>
        <img src="images/interface.png"/> 
        <p> In the exercise 'Time is on my Side'. I went with a simple grid format with a top nav bar to sort out the four sections that I had grouped my events under. The panic button is orange because it is meant to be something that stands out from all the rest. I thought it would be funny to center the story of the site into panic, since most people, when they select a portion of their day do not experience as much panic as I had experienced that day. Losing my keyes was definitely an anomaly and I wanted to highlight that. The other buttons are sorted into a greyscale gradient to show that there is some distinction between the three, but that in the end, panic (as in all things in life), is the element that is the most important. 
            <br>
          The 'hide all' and 'show all' buttons are styled the same way and also stand out from muted grey. the 'show all' button serves to be a kind of reset and the 'hide all' button, as a way to clear the board.  </p>

        <h2 id="work"> Google Forms </h2>
        <img src="images/googleforms.png"/> 
        <p> This is Google Forms. I often use google forms to create forms for PIXEL graphic design club. We do these to gain feedback from members and keep track of opinions, sruveys, and transportation. It is particularly useful because of the drag function in creating options as well as the diffierent fields that can but inputted in each question. This has been immensely useful because it is so versatile. It's also a good platform for switching into other tools such as google sheets.</p>

        <h2 id="work"> Evernote Interface</h2>
        <img src="images/evernote.png"/> 
        <p> I’ve used Evernote ever since my first year of college and the interface has changed a lot in terms of usability and aesthetic appearance over the years. According to the Nielsen Norman Group’s article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/">‘Usability 101: Introduction to Usability’</a>,determinants of good usability include: <strong> learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. </strong> To summarize:</p>           <br> 
        <ul>                    
            <li>Learnability-  How easily does the user complete basic tasks when first encountering the design? </li>
            <li> Efficiency - How fast can they use it once learned? </h4>
            <li> Memorability - How quickly can someone recall the system once away from it for a while?</li>
            <li>Errors- How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors? </li>
            <li> Satisfaction - pleasure from using the design (quirkiness) </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p> Does the new Evernote interface, introduced recently over the past year reflect good learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction?  What I liked about the new updates were the improvements made to the navigation on the left-hand side. Since I’ve been using this program for years, I have 62 notebooks and hundred of notes to organize. Yet, I only use a few notebooks and a few ongoing notes regularly. I put these on ‘shortcuts’ and they marked off according to file type through visual icons on the side. You can add tags to help locate the file later on and there is also a section for recent notes, displaying recently edited documents. All in all, I picked up Evernote quite quickly and now use it every day for personal and academic work. The pleasing appearance, while having no effect on usability, give me satisfaction (see above) and keeps me coming back as a regular user. </p>
